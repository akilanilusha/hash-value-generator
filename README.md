# 🔐 Plain Text to Hash Converter (Python)

This is a simple Python-based command-line tool that converts plain text into a hash value using popular cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1, etc.).

## 📌 Features

- Convert any string (plain text) to a hashed value.
- Support for multiple hashing algorithms (SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1, etc.).
- User-friendly CLI input.

## 🧠 What is a Hash Value?

A **hash value** is a fixed-length string of characters generated by a hash function from an input (or 'message'), typically plain text.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash.
- **One-way**: You cannot reverse-engineer the original input from the hash.
- **Fixed Size**: No matter how long the input is, the hash output will have a consistent length.
- **Collision-resistant**: It’s hard to find two different inputs with the same hash (depending on the algorithm).

## ❓ Why Do We Need Hashing?

Hashing is used in a wide range of applications in cybersecurity and data management:

- ✅ **Password Security**: Instead of storing actual passwords, systems store their hashes.
- ✅ **Data Integrity Checks**: Hashes help verify that a file or message hasn’t been altered.
- ✅ **Digital Signatures**: Hashes are used in cryptographic systems to sign and verify messages.
- ✅ **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Hash tables use hashes to quickly find data.
- ✅ **Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies**: Hashing ensures security and integrity of blocks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### ✔ Python 3
Python is the core language used for this project, known for its simplicity and readability.

### ✔ hashlib
Python’s built-in `hashlib` module is used for secure hashes and message digests. It supports:
- `sha256` (Recommended for security)
- `md5` (Fast but not secure for critical systems)
- `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha384`, `sha512`

This module provides reliable cryptographic functions used across multiple industries.
